# Mazer

### BootDev Hackathon 2025 submission

---


I have made a maze game that looks simple on its surface, but there is a twist! The game doesn't think it's quite enough to beat the player, so it's going to do anything it can to block your path at any turn! Even if it has to throw walls at you to keep you from the goal!

Not hard enough? Good (or bad) news! The goal will run from you! Don't think the goal is operating with the same rules as you are, or you'll be sorry!
